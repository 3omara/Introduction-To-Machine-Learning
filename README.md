# Introduction-To-Machine-Learning
Throughout this college course, we examined basic machine learning concepts thoroughly, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent/Ascent, K Nearest Neighbors, State Vector Machine, Clustering (Hierarchical &amp; K Means), Decision Trees , and Na√Øve Bayes. 

In this repository, I present the final project for this course. In this project, we were supposed to apply the Sklearn ready functions on a given dataset; however, I, tried to implement these functions myself alongside applying the Sklearn ones. This project really helped me better understand many critical concepts in machine learning, and made me more familiar with linear algebra and vectorization.
